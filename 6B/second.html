    <h2>Candle World</h2>
    <P>Discover the different types of wax used to make scented candles in this handy guide. We’ve answered all your candle wax questions including – Where does wax come from? What’s the best wax for candles? And what’s the difference between Soy Wax, Beeswax, Coconut Wax and more.</p><br><br>
    <h3>Soy Wax</h3>
    <p>Soy Wax
        If you've heard of any kind of candle wax, it's probably soy. And that's for good reason. Soy Wax is the go-to wax choice for many candle makers nowadays thanks to its eco-friendly credentials, clean burn and quality scent throw. Here at Osmology, we have a huge collection of hand-poured soy wax candles made by home fragrance brands we know you'll love.</p>
        <h3>Coconut Wax</h3>
        <p>Coconut wax burns slowly and cleanly and throws scent extremely well. It is used less than other waxes in scented candles because it's on the expensive side, but with its sustainability and natural processing, it's the eco wax de jour.</p>
        <h3>Beeswax</h3>
        <p>Beeswax is the oldest type of candle wax and is sourced naturally from bees. Beeswax candles are considered among the healthiest due to being smokeless and sootless, but will often be mixed with other wax types when used for scented candles.</p>
